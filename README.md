## Introduction

I will give a brief explanation of this project and its goals here later on.

## Features

This will contain a more detailed list of features further down the line,
as of now all you need to know is *dies*

## Usage

Explain how developers can use your API, including any important concepts or considerations.

### Installation

This will include installation instruction later.

### Authentication

The requests under this API require a token, which can be configured in your environment variables as `APItoken`. <br>
It is recommended to set this to something hard to guess, preferably a randomly generated senquence of characters.

```csharp
string CorrectToken = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("APItoken") ?? "D3F4ULTT0KEN";
```

### Endpoints

This will contain a list of supported API endpoints with an explanation of their implementations,
once the API is further through its development.

## Contributing

This project is currently a solo effort, and contributions are not accepted as of now.
Feel free to fork the repository if you want to explore or modify the code for personal use,
or reach out to me in case you have any suggestions or questions.
